1. list of network interfaces

command: ifconfig -l

2a. broadcasting

Broadcasting in a computer network is transmitting a message which does not require a response to all users of the network.One computer in a network sends a data packet to all other users at the same time.
The sender does not need to indicate recipient addresses – this is how the broadcast process differs from unicast, where only a single known recipient is addressed. The general advantage of broadcasting is that information can be distributed without having to be transmitted multiple times.

command: ifconfig en0 | grep broadcast | cut -d ' ' -f 6

2b. Identify all IP adresses which are part of the same subnet

command: arp -a | cut -d ' ' -f 2

3. Identify the MAC address of the Wi-Fi card

MAC address: A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC). For communications within a network segment, it is used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

command: ifconfig | grep "ether " | cut -d ' ' -f 2

4. Identifiy the default gateway in the routing table

command: netstat -rn | grep default | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}'

5. Identify the IP address of the DNS that responds to the following url: slash16.org

command: dig slash16.org | grep slash | tail -n 4 | awk '{print $5}'

6. Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server you’re using

Written in my own words: You can get the information about DNS server that I'm using if you type: "scutil --dns" or "cat /etc/resolv.conf". Both of these commands give you nameserver info, and on the same row is the IP address that you were looking for.

7. Query an external DNS server on the slash16.org domain name

command: nslookup slash16.org 8.8.8.8

8.  Find the provider of slash16.org

Written in my own words: You can just type in "whois slash16.org" and find the 'Name Server'-section which tells the provider of the slash16.org. 

9. Find the external IP of 42.fr

command: nslookup 42.fr 8.8.8.8

Output: Server:		 	8.8.8.8
Address:				8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:			  42.fr
Address: 163.172.250.13
Name:	 42.fr
Address: 163.172.250.12

10. Identify the network devices between your computer and the slash16.org domain

command: traceroute -w 1 slash16.org

11. Use the output of the previous command to find the name and IP address of the device that makes the link between you (local network) and the outside world

12. Find the IP that was assigned to you by dhcp server

command: ipconfig getoption en0 server_identifier

13. Thanks to the previous question and the reverse DNS find the name of your host

command: nslookup 10.51.1.253
